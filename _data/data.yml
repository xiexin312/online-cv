        1. **NB-IoT SoC chip:** Our product is a Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) SoC chip. I focus on the demodulation
           and decode of physical layer downlink channels, including algorithm design with MATLAB andimplementation with DSP. Related algorithms include space frequency block code (SFBC) demodulation and
           tail-biting convolutional code (TBCC) decoding, etc. There are only three engineers and one project leader in
           this group, where I serve as the first joined engineer and participate in the whole procedure. Besides, I am also
           familiar with the overall flow of baseband, and the basic function of other baseband blocks, such as cell search,
           channel estimation, frequency/tracking loop, etc. My work is mainly based on 3GPP protocols such as technical
           specifications 36.211, 36.212, 36.213, 36.331, and 36.521.

        1. **Hierarchical Visible Light Communication System:** Visible light communication (VLC) has attached a lot of
        interests due to its safety, practicability, and effciency. In a VLC system with multiple light-emitting-diodes
        (LEDs), two different types of channels named imaging channel and non-imaging channel can be used to transmit
        data. In this work, basing on the channel characteristics, we propose a novel hierarchical VLC system which
        supports two different types of receivers simultaneously. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate how to achieve
        maximum throughput with optimal power allocation. Numerical results are also provided to corroborate our
        designs. The work has been published in IEEE ICUWB.
        
        2. **Antenna Calibration in Massive MIMO:** In the massive MIMO era, there are hundreds of antenna elements at
        one single base station (BS). It becomes critical to take full advantage of time-division duplexing (TDD) channel
        reciprocity to learn the downlink (DL) channel state information (CSI) from the uplink (UL) channel measurements
        at the BS. However, due to different radio frequency branches for transmitting and receiving, antenna
        calibration at the BS is necessary to effect this reciprocity between the end-to-end DL and UL channels. In massive
        MIMO, this procedure becomes extremely challenging since all the existing antenna calibration approaches
        do not scale well with the size of the antenna array. In our work, we rely on the compressive sensing (CS) theory
        to develop an efficient and robust way to calibrate the massive antenna array at the BS, which only requires
        CSI feedbacks in the order of log *N* instead of *N* as in those conventional calibration schemes. Extensive simulations
        demonstrate our approach can maintain the whole large scale antenna system in a “calibrated” state
        with only a small amount of feedback overhead. The work has been published in IEEE ICUWB. Besides the RF
        gains mismatch, as the antenna elements are placed close to each other, the mutual coupling effects among the
        adjacent antennas also become pronounced. Different coupling matrices for transmission and reception also hurt
        the end-to-end UL/DL channel reciprocity. Aiming to restore the end-to-end channel reci-procity with a small amount
        of over-the-air (OTA) resources, we propose to estimate the gain mismatches of the RF electronics and
        the mutual coupling mismatches separately. Specifically, we rely on the pilot exchanges among the BS antennas
        and the symmetry of the antenna array to recover the transmitting and receiving gains of all the RF components.
        Unlike prior calibration works, our schemes can recover the off-diagonal elements in the calibration matrix as
        well. This work has been published in IEEE IWCMC.
